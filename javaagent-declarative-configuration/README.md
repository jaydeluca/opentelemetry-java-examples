# Java Agent Declarative Configuration Example

This example demonstrates how to use [declarative configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/#declarative-configuration) with the OpenTelemetry Java Agent to configure tracing behavior.

The configuration file is located at [otel-agent-config.yaml](./otel-agent-config.yaml).

This Spring Boot application includes two endpoints:
- `/actuator/health` - A health check endpoint (from Spring Boot Actuator) that is configured to be excluded from tracing
- `/api/example` - A simple API endpoint that will be traced normally

## End-to-End Instructions

### Prerequisites
* Java 17 or higher
* OpenTelemetry Java Agent JAR file (see next step)

Download the OpenTelemetry Java Agent:
```bash
# Download the latest OpenTelemetry Java Agent
curl -L -o opentelemetry-javaagent.jar https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```

The OpenTelemetry contrib extension will be automatically downloaded during the build process.

**Note:** If you prefer to download the extension manually or need a different version, you can:
1. Find the latest version at [Sonatype](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.opentelemetry.contrib/opentelemetry-samplers)
2. Download it with: `curl -L -o opentelemetry-javaagent-extension.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/opentelemetry/contrib/opentelemetry-samplers/[VERSION]/opentelemetry-samplers-[VERSION].jar`
3. Reference it in the run command: `-Dotel.javaagent.extensions=opentelemetry-javaagent-extension.jar`

### Step 1: Build the Application

```bash
# Build the JAR - Run from the javaagent-declarative-configuration directory
../gradlew bootJar
```

### Step 2: Run with OpenTelemetry Java Agent

```bash
# From the javaagent-declarative-configuration directory

# Run with the OpenTelemetry Java Agent and contrib extension
java -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.javaagent.extensions=build/agent/opentelemetry-javaagent-extension.jar \
     -Dotel.experimental.config.file=$(pwd)/otel-agent-config.yaml \
     -jar build/libs/javaagent-declarative-configuration.jar
```

### Step 3: Test the Endpoints

Open a new terminal and test both endpoints:

```bash
# This endpoint will NOT be traced (excluded by configuration)
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# This endpoint WILL be traced normally
curl http://localhost:8080/api/example
```

### Step 4: Verify Tracing Behavior

Check the application logs to see:
- Health check requests (`/actuator/health`) should NOT generate traces (excluded by configuration)
- API requests (`/api/example`) should generate traces with console output

## Configuration

The `otel-agent-config.yaml` file demonstrates rule-based sampling using declarative configuration to exclude health checks from tracing:

```yaml
tracer_provider:
  sampler:
    rule_based_routing:
      fallback_sampler:
        always_on:
      span_kind: SERVER
      rules:
        - action: DROP
          attribute: url.path
          pattern: /actuator.*
```

This configuration:
- Uses the `rule_based_routing` sampler from the OpenTelemetry contrib extension
- Excludes health check endpoints (`/actuator.*`) from tracing using the `DROP` action
- Samples all other requests using the `always_on` fallback sampler
- Only applies to `SERVER` span kinds
- Requires the OpenTelemetry contrib extension JAR to be loaded
